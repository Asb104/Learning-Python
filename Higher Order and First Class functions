#python has a nifty was of writting a getter function inline
# first call functions such as lambda functions are functions that can be passed as a parameter for a higher order function such as this lambda function 

lambda x, y : x+y
sum = lambda x, y : x+y

var = add_two(18, 24)
print(var)

#a higher order function is a function that accepts another function as a parameter such as this who function

def who(data, identify):
  return identify(data)

#def my_identifying_funct(data):
 # return data['name']
  
user = {'name' : 'Andrew', 'surname' : 'Baker'}

#print(who(user, my_identifying_funct))

#look who a lambda function can simplify this

print(who(user, lambda x: x['name']))

#using this method we wouldnt need my_identifying_funct() so we will commit it out.
